^ GitHub won't merge this. We have no choice but to resolve it command line.

# Why .gitignore?

1. For your sanity
2. Avoid conflicts in files that don't matter
3. Remove unnecessary [noise](https://medium.com/@satorusasozaki/swift-gitignore-by-github-explained-b5dc7479c661)

### Thanks, Uncle Jared!

# Where to install .gitignore

## 1. Your computer's git config (protects your repos)
## 2. Your group's git repo (in case theirs failed*)

> \* Trust no one, Dr. Jones. -- Nazi double agent

---

## Make .gitignore the first file you add+commit to your group project repo!

Do this instead.
