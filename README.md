# All the things

## Best lines from Star Wars

### Episode IV: A New Hope

They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer the same fate as Alderaan. Your destiny lies along a different path than mine. The Force will be with you...always!


### Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back

Use the Force. Yes... Now...the stone. Feel it. Concentrate!

Oh, no. We'll never get it out now. 

So certain are you. Always with you it cannot be done. Hear you nothing that I say? 

Master, moving stones around is one thing. This is totally different. 

No! No different! Only different in your mind. You must unlearn what you have learned. 

All right, I'll give it a try. 

No! Try not. Do. Or do not. There is no try. 

I can't. It's too big. Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? Hm? Mmmm. And well you should not. For my ally in the Force. And a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. It's energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we... ..not this crude matter. You must feel the Force around you. Here, between you...me...the tree...the rock...everywhere! Yes, even between this land and that ship! You want the impossible.

### Episode VI: Return of the Jedi

Sir, enemy ships in Sector 47!

IT'S A TRAP!

* Karl would be the captain and have a fabulous parrot
* Zeb would be first mate and have an eye patch but also have a custom-made telescope that no one else could use
* Trevor would be a lookout and double as the ship's best swordsman
* Marcus would be a talking skull head. Everyone would call him Murray instead of Marcus.
